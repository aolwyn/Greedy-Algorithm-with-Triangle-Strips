# Greedy-Algorithm-with-Triangle-Strips
a greedy algorithm to build "triangle strips" in a triangle mesh was developed. It is more efficient to render a triangle mesh as a small set of triangle strips rather than a set of individual triangles. This program shows the step-through of a greedy algorithm that develops this idea.
